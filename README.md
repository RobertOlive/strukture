# strukture
An app designed to organize and simplify your life. 

Everyone needs a little strukture in their life. Make your life simpler by scheduling your day, planning your month, and easily creating a budget.

My goal with this app was to create something that I would use - an app designed to simplify and optimize my life by helping keep track of daily tasks as well and keep an eye on my monthly budget. My design philosophy was to keep it simple and clean: many productivity apps are so over-designed that many people (like myself) don't end up using them.
